# E-Com Backend Challenge
The back-end only of a e-commerce style website.

## Description
This project is practice making the backend of an e-commerce website interact with data using nodejs, expressjs, ORM, and SQL. In a route testing application, like insomnia or Thunder Client, you can see all categories, products, and tags, as well as searching for each category by individual id.
